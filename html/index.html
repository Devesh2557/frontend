    <p>Rana Sangram Singh I (c. 12 April 1482 – 30 January 1528), popularly known as Rana Sanga, was the Maharana of Mewar from 1508 to 1528 CE. Belonging to the Sisodia Rajput dynasty, through his capable leadership, he transformed the Kingdom of Mewar into the most powerful state in northern India in the early 16th century.[2] He controlled parts of present-day Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh with his capital at Chittor.[3] His reign was admired by several of his contemporaries, including the first Mughal Emperor Babur, who described him as the "greatest Indian ruler" of that time. The Mughal historian Abd al-Qadir Badayuni called Sanga the bravest of all Rajputs.[4][better source needed]

        In his long military career, Sanga achieved a series of unbroken successes against several neighbouring sultanates, most notably in the Mewar-Delhi Sultanate wars and Mewar- Malwa Conflict. He united several Rajput clans for the first time since the Second Battle of Tarain and marched against the invading Babur, who founded the Mughal Empire.
        
        Despite initial success, Sanga suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Khanwa through Babur's use of gunpowder weaponry, which was unknown in northern India at the time. His defeat at Khanwa is seen as a landmark event in the Mughal conquest of northern India. In contemporary texts, he is described as the Hindu Emperor (Hindupati) of northern India.[5]</p>

    <p>Parshuram Jayanti holds a great religious significance among Hindus as this day is commemorated to celebrate the birth anniversary of Lord Shri Parshuram. He is considered as the sixth incarnation of Bhagwan Vishnu, the preserver of this universe. He was born on Tritiya Tithi under the Pradosh Kaal. The main purpose of Parshuram Ji's incarnation was to eliminate irreligious, sinful and ruthless kings and also to reduce the burden of earth. He also destroyed Kshatriyas 21 times from earth.
        Lord Parshuram ji was a Brahmin who had qualities of a Kshatriyas. It is also believed that once Lord Parshuram attacked Lord Ganesha. Parshuram is one of the Ashta Chrianjeevi's and still present on earth somewhere in the mountains. According to the Hindu Scriptures, Bhagwan Parshuram Ji will become the mentor of Lord Kali (one of the 10th incarnation of Lord Vishnu), who will teach him martial arts and give him Shastra and Shaastra Vidhya.</p>

    <p>Krishna (/ˈkrɪʃnə/;[12] Sanskrit: कृष्ण, IAST: Kṛṣṇa [ˈkr̩ʂɳɐ]) is a major deity in Hinduism. He is worshipped as the eighth avatar of Vishnu and also as the Supreme God in his own right.[13] He is the god of protection, compassion, tenderness, and love;[14][1] and is widely revered among Hindu divinities.[15] Krishna's birthday is celebrated every year by Hindus on Krishna Janmashtami according to the lunisolar Hindu calendar, which falls in late August or early September of the Gregorian calendar.[16][17][18]

        The anecdotes and narratives of Krishna's life are generally titled as Krishna Līlā. He is a central figure in the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata Purana, the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, and the Bhagavad Gita, and is mentioned in many Hindu philosophical, theological, and mythological texts.[19] They portray him in various perspectives: as a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero, and the universal supreme being.[20] His iconography reflects these legends and shows him in different stages of his life, such as an infant eating butter, a young boy playing a flute, a young boy with Radha or surrounded by female devotees, or a friendly charioteer giving counsel to Arjuna.</p>
     <h1>Shree Ram</h1>

    <p>Rama (/ˈrɑːmə/;[4] Sanskrit: राम, IAST: Rāma, Sanskrit: [ˈraːmɐ] ⓘ) is a major deity in Hinduism. He is the seventh and one of the most popular avatars of Vishnu. In Rama-centric traditions of Hinduism, he is considered the Supreme Being.[5]

        According to the Ramayana, Rama was born to Dasaratha and his first wife Kausalya in Ayodhya, the capital of the Kingdom of Kosala. His siblings included Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna. He married Sita. Born in a royal family, Rama's life is described in the Hindu texts as one challenged by unexpected changes, such as an exile into impoverished and difficult circumstances, and challenges of ethical questions and moral dilemmas.[6] Of all his travails, the most notable is the kidnapping of Sita by demon-king Ravana, followed by the determined and epic efforts of Rama and Lakshmana to gain her freedom and destroy the evil Ravana against great odds.</p> -->
